# Contact Form Setup Instructions

## Overview

This setup creates a contact form that:

- Collects user queries through a mobile-friendly form
- Sends email notifications to kmarnaveen97@gmail.com
- Saves all submissions to the specified Google Sheet
- Provides real-time feedback to users

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Google Apps Script Setup

1. **Open Google Apps Script**

   - Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create New Project**

   - Click "New Project"
   - Replace the default `Code.gs` content with the code from `google-apps-script.js`

3. **Configure the Script**

   - The spreadsheet ID is already set to: `1TaQdlFVywMx-ErwACd1CwHEnAHjQav73rXbhi_pAbzE`
   - The email recipient is set to: `kmarnaveen97@gmail.com`
   - Sheet name will be: `Lead Queries`

4. **Deploy as Web App**

   - Click "Deploy" → "New deployment"
   - Choose "Web app" as the type
   - Set execute as: "Me"
   - Set access to: "Anyone"
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Copy the Web App URL

5. **Update Frontend Code**
   - In `src/components/MobileDock.tsx`, replace the fetch URL:
   ```typescript
   const response = await fetch('YOUR_WEB_APP_URL_HERE', {
   ```
   - Replace `YOUR_WEB_APP_URL_HERE` with the actual Web App URL from step 4

### 2. Google Sheets Setup

The Google Sheet is already created and accessible. The script will automatically:

- Create a "Lead Queries" sheet if it doesn't exist
- Add headers: Timestamp, Name, Email, Phone, Query, Status
- Auto-resize columns for better readability

### 3. Testing the Setup

1. **Test the Script**

   - In Google Apps Script, run the `testScript()` function
   - Check if a test entry appears in the Google Sheet
   - Verify that a test email is sent to kmarnaveen97@gmail.com

2. **Test the Form**
   - Open the website on mobile
   - Click the floating contact button
   - Fill out and submit the form
   - Verify the entry appears in Google Sheets and email is received

### 4. Email Configuration

The script sends beautiful HTML emails with:

- Professional header with Mountpole branding
- All contact details in a structured format
- The user's query highlighted
- Action reminder for timely response
- Reply-to set to the user's email for easy response

### 5. Permissions Required

When deploying, Google will ask for permissions to:

- Access Google Sheets (to save form data)
- Send emails via Gmail (to notify about new queries)
- These are required for the functionality to work

### 6. Security Notes

- The Web App URL should be kept secure
- Only the contact form should use this endpoint
- The script validates and sanitizes input data
- User data is only stored in your Google Sheet and emailed to the specified address

### 7. Customization Options

You can modify:

- Email template in the `sendEmailNotification` function
- Sheet name by changing `SHEET_NAME` variable
- Additional data fields by updating both frontend form and script
- Email formatting and styling in the HTML template

### 8. Troubleshooting

**CORS "Failed to fetch" Error Fix:**
If you get a "Failed to fetch" error, the frontend code has been updated to use `mode: "no-cors"` which should resolve this issue. Make sure to:

1. **Redeploy the Google Apps Script** with the updated code that includes CORS headers
2. **Clear browser cache** and try again
3. **Test in incognito mode** to avoid cached errors

**Common Issues:**

- If emails aren't sending: Check Gmail API permissions
- If data isn't saving: Verify spreadsheet ID and permissions
- If form shows error but data is saved: This is normal with no-cors mode
- If CORS issues persist: Ensure the web app is deployed with "Anyone" access

**Logs:**

- Check Google Apps Script logs for error details
- Browser console will show any frontend errors
- Test with the `testScript()` function first
- The form will show success message even if there are minor backend issues (this is intentional with no-cors mode)

**Testing Steps:**

1. Submit a test form
2. Check if data appears in Google Sheets (this confirms the script is working)
3. Check if email notification is received
4. If both work, the form is functioning correctly regardless of any console errors

## Data Flow
